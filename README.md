# Neuroevolutionary Investor
Neuroevolution-based system that simulates investments in the stock market, based on the BOVESPA index. Final project of the course _SSC0713 - Evolutionary systems applyied to robotics_.


## Installation
First, make sure you have a recent version of Python 3. To install the dependencies, open a command shell in the project's root directory and execute the following:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the program, use the command:
- python3 main.py


## How it works
To improve itself, the system uses concepts of **evolutionary computing**. Specifically, a **genetic algorithm**, metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, is used. The evolution process used by the program can be summarized in the following steps:

    1 - Generate a population of *n* individuals; each individual represents an investor.
    2 -
